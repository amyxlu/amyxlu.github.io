_Here is a [resume](/assets/AmyLuCV.pdf), but it is probably outdated, and certainly incompletely captures my passions. Feel free to reach out at amyxlu [at] cs [dot] toronto [dot] edu or chat in-person instead; I'd love to learn from other humans (like yourself!)._

Prior to U of T/Vector, I spent 6 great months at [Harvard Medical School](https://www.scholars.hms.harvard.edu/) applying machine learning to uncover the genomic causes of epilepsy, and breathing in nightly views of the Charles River on my bike.

Prior to Harvard, I wrote my [undergraduate thesis](https://github.com/amyxlu/femur-enhancers/blob/master/thesis.pdf) on interpretable convolutional neural networks and femur growth plate genomic regulation, advised by [Dr. Andrew Doxey](http://doxey.uwaterloo.ca/index.html).

Prior to my undergraduate thesis, I spent a summer at EPFL in Switzerland, using molecular dynamics simulations to understand mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, funded by the [Scholarship of Excellence in Research](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/education/summer-research-program/).

Prior to EPFL, I learned to code while working on data visualization and pharmacoepidemiology with the [U of Toronto Faculty of Pharmacy](https://pharmacy.utoronto.ca/users/cadarette-s/).

Prior to that, I was in a [pre-admission to pharmacy](https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/future-students/conditional-admission-pharmacy-cap) undergraduate program, but became fascinated enough with the world of computer science to forego the pharmacist trajectory.

I obtained my Bachelor of Science from the University of Waterloo. My formative experiences here include befriending diverse students and supporting mental health crises as a Residence Life Don, living in the residence program of the [Velocity start-up incubator](http://velocity.uwaterloo.ca/), and making cool things and winning cool prizes at hackathons. The most eye-opening experience of my life, though, was working in a [rural hospital in Tanzania](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mediciconlafrica/sets/72157632578798992/), which cemented my desire to work in healthcare.
