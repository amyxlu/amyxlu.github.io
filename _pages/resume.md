_[Here](/assets/AmyLuCV.pdf) is my CV, but it is probably outdated, and certainly incompletely captures my passions. Feel free to reach out instead at amyxlu [at] cs [dot] toronto [dot] edu._

I am currently a Masters candidate at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), working on self-supervised learning for protein sequences, and learning to bike in the winter.  

During my Masters, I was a Visiting Student Researcher at [Stanford University](anshul.kundaje.net), exploring domain adaptation in genomics, and standing in line at the Salt and Straw in Downtown Palo Alto.

Prior to my Masters, I spent 6 great months at [Harvard Medical School](https://www.scholars.hms.harvard.edu/), using machine learning to understand the genetics of epilepsy, and breathing in nightly views of the Charles River on my bike.

Prior to Harvard, I was writing my [undergraduate thesis](https://github.com/amyxlu/femur-enhancers/blob/master/thesis.pdf) on interpreting convolutional neural networks to understand enhancer motifs regulating femur growth, and avoiding the infamous geese of Waterloo.

Prior to my undergraduate thesis, I spent a summer at [EPFL](http://lbm.epfl.ch/) in Switzerland, using molecular dynamics to simulate enzyme-membrane interactions, and catching the train at Gare de Renens on Friday evenings (10 countries were checked-off altogether!).

Prior to EPFL, I learned to code while working on data visualization and pharmacoepidemiology with the [U of Toronto Faculty of Pharmacy](https://pharmacy.utoronto.ca/users/cadarette-s/). Prior to that, I was in a [pre-admission to pharmacy](https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/future-students/conditional-admission-pharmacy-cap) undergraduate program, but became fascinated enough with the world of computer science to forego the pharmacist trajectory.
