**I am broadly interested in developing machine learning methods for the unique needs of biological data.** I am especially interested in methods enabling generalization to natural distribution shifts and practical use cases in therapeutics and discovery.

I will be a [EECS PhD student](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley starting Fall 2021, working with Nilah Ioannidis, Yun Song, and Sergey Levine. Previously, I was at [insitro](https://insitro.com), using machine learning to accelerate drug discovery. I completed my Masters at the University of Toronto, advised by [Alan Moses](http://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/) and [Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/), and was a visitor in [Anshul Kundaje](http://anshul.kundaje.net)'s group at Stanford University, as a recipient of the [NSERC CGS-MSFSS](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/cgsforeignstudy-bescetudeetranger_eng.asp) scholarship.

My research interests were shaped by wonderful mentors at the [University of Waterloo](http://doxey.uwaterloo.ca/), [Harvard Medical School](https://www.slizlab.org/), and [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne](https://lbm.epfl.ch/). In my spare time, I enjoy playing Chopin and hip-hop covers on the piano and eating 90% dark chocolate. You might get emails from me as Xiaoping Lu (pronounced as _shiao-ping_, and written as 逯晓萍).
