My research interests center around the question: **how can we develop generalizable and interpretable machine learning methods for the unique needs of biomedical data?**

I am currently working on this problem at [insitro](insitro.com). I completed my Masters at the [University of Toronto](https://vectorinstitute.ai) and the [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](http://web.cs.toronto.edu/), advised by [Dr. Alan Moses](http://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/) and [Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/), funded by the [NSERC CGS-M award](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/CGSM-BESCM_eng.asp). I partially completed my Masters as a Visiting Student Researcher in [Dr. Anshul Kundaje](http://anshul.kundaje.net)'s group at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), as a recipient of the [NSERC CGS-MSFSS](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/cgsforeignstudy-bescetudeetranger_eng.asp) scholarship.

My research interests were shaped by wonderful mentors at [Harvard Medical School](https://www.slizlab.org/), [University of Waterloo](http://doxey.uwaterloo.ca/) and [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne](https://lbm.epfl.ch/). I work with [Research to the People](https://www.researchtothepeople.org/), a non-profit connecting patients of complex diseases, researchers, and industry partners. In my spare time, I enjoy making piano hip-hop covers, good journalism, and 90% dark chocolate. I also love solo traveling, including adventures in Egypt, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Tanzania.
