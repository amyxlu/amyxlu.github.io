My research interests center around this question: **how can we take recent breakthroughs in deep learning beyond classifying cat videos to tackle "impossible" medical problems?** Specifically, I am interested in personalized medicine and drug discovery from -omics data, using methods from natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. I am also broadly interested in protein engineering, clinical decision support, and metagenomics.

I am currently a graduate student at the [University of Toronto](https://vectorinstitute.ai) and the [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](http://web.cs.toronto.edu/), advised by [Dr. Alan Moses](http://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/) and [Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/), and funded by a [NSERC scholarship](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/CGSM-BESCM_eng.asp). I am a part-time associated personnel with [Boston Children's Hospital](https://www.childrenshospital.org/research).

Prior to U of T/Vector, I spent 8 great months at [Harvard Medical School](https://www.scholars.hms.harvard.edu/) applying machine learning to uncover the genomic causes of epilepsy, and breathing in nightly views of the Charles River on my bike.

Prior to Harvard, I wrote my undergraduate thesis on interpretable convolutional neural networks and femur growth plate genomic regulation, advised by [Dr. Andrew Doxey](http://doxey.uwaterloo.ca/index.html).

Prior to my undergraduate thesis, I spent a summer at EPFL using molecular dynamics simulations to understand mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, funded by the [Scholarship of Excellence in Research](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/education/summer-research-program/).

Prior to EPFL, I learned to code while working on data visualization and pharmacoepidemiology with the [U of Toronto Faculty of Pharmacy](https://pharmacy.utoronto.ca/users/cadarette-s/).

Prior to that, I was in a [pre-admission to pharmacy](https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/future-students/conditional-admission-pharmacy-cap) undergraduate program, but I changed my mind after discovering the fascinating world of computational biology.

In addition, I work with [SVAI](https://sv.ai/), a great non-profit enabling collaborations of rare disease patients, industry partners, and academic researchers. The most eye-opening experience of my life was working in a [rural hospital in Tanzania](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mediciconlafrica/sets/72157632578798992/). Travelling is fun, and my solo travelling adventures include Egypt, Tansania, Bosnia, and Serbia. In my spare time, I like reading, biking, making piano hip-hop covers, good journalism, and 90% dark chocolate.
