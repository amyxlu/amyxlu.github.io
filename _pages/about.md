My research interests center around the question: **how can we develop biologically-inspired machine learning algorithms to solve difficult medical problems**, with the same level of real-world success as in computer vision and NLP?

Specifically, I am interested in using self-supervised techniques to develop generalizable representations for genomic sequences, by improving upon new algorithms in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). I am also broadly interested in protein engineering, algorithmic fairness, and clinical decision support.

I am currently pursuing my Masters at the [University of Toronto](https://vectorinstitute.ai) and the [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](http://web.cs.toronto.edu/), advised by [Dr. Alan Moses](http://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/) and [Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/), and funded by the [NSERC CGS-M scholarship](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/CGSM-BESCM_eng.asp). I am a part-time associated personnel with [Boston Children's Hospital](https://www.childrenshospital.org/research). In addition, I work with [SVAI](https://sv.ai/), a non-profit connecting rare disease patients, researchers, and industry partners. I am currently partially completing my thesis at Stanford University as a Visiting Student Researcher, advised by [Dr. Anshul Kundaje](http://anshul.kundaje.net).

My research interests are shaped by wonderful mentors at [Harvard Medical School](https://www.slizlab.org/), [University of Waterloo](http://doxey.uwaterloo.ca/), [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne](https://lbm.epfl.ch/), and [Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy](http://phm.utoronto.ca/~cadarette/). In my spare time, I like reading, biking, making piano hip-hop covers, good journalism, and 90% dark chocolate. I also love solo traveling, including adventures in Egypt, Serbia, and Bosnia.
