**I am broadly interested in developing machine learning methods for the unique needs of biological data.** I am especially interested in methods enabling generalization to natural distribution shifts and practical use cases in therapeutics and discovery.

I am currently exploring these interests at [insitro](https://insitro.com), using machine learning to accelerate drug discovery. I completed my Masters at the University of Toronto and the Vector Institute, advised by [Alan Moses](http://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/) and [Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/). I partially completed my Masters as a Visiting Student Researcher in [Anshul Kundaje](http://anshul.kundaje.net)'s group at Stanford University, as a recipient of the [NSERC CGS-MSFSS](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/cgsforeignstudy-bescetudeetranger_eng.asp) scholarship.

My research interests were shaped by wonderful mentors at [Harvard Medical School](https://www.slizlab.org/), [University of Waterloo](http://doxey.uwaterloo.ca/) and [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne](https://lbm.epfl.ch/). I work with [Research to the People](https://www.researchtothepeople.org/), a non-profit connecting patients of complex diseases, researchers, and industry partners. In my spare time, I enjoy making piano covers, visiting museums, and eating 90% dark chocolate.
