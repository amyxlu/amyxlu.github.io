<p> love in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xm7s9eGxU&ab_channel=DistantMirrors">gymnopedie</a> <br> feb 11, 2023 </p>


<p>[verse 1]</p>

<i>
<p>i&rsquo;m not really one to write love songs <br> tender were the rights that were wrong <br> love is too thin, too bland of a word <br>to paint the softness of warmth <br> (but I&rsquo;ll try to)</p>
</i>

<p>[chorus]</p>

<i>
<p>to write, a song, to say what is true <br> (that I feel) <br> beaming suns when I&rsquo;m with you <br>to write, a song, to celebrate -- <br>today, happy birthday to you</p>
</i>

<p>[verse 2]</p>

<i>
<p>life is short and life is long <br>tides will rise us up and bring us down <br>let&rsquo;s build a moat, just like the day <br>my heart fell at half moon bay</p>
</i>

<p> [chorus]</p>

<i>
    <p>(and i'll try to) <br>write, a song, for all that is true <br>(cause my heart is) <br>swelling up when i'm with you <br> to write, a song, to celebrate -- <br>today, happy birthday to you </p>
