I will be at NeurIPS 2020, helping to present [dataset and benchmarks for measuring out-of-sample generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07282) at the main conference, and two works at the workshops for [Machine Learning for Health](https://ml4health.github.io/2019/) and [Fair ML for Health](https://www.fairmlforhealth.com/).
